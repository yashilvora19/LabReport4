# Lab Report 4

## Commands Run in the Lab Competition

This lab report will take a closer look at all of the commands run in the lab competition and how I used shortcuts to complete alal the tasks quickly as I could.
For the competition, I had to complete the following tasks: 

1. *Setup* Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
2. *Setup* Fork the repository
3. *The real deal* Start the timer!
4. Log into ieng6
5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)

For the purposes of this report, we will start fromm step 4 and assume that the setup is already completed.
